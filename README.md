# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tutorial By Bhupeshwar Pathania

NLP tutorial is designed for both beginners and professionals. Whether you’re a data scientist, a developer, or someone curious about the power of language, 
my tutorial will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to take your understanding of NLP to the next level.

# What is NLP?

NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is the branch of Artificial Intelligence that gives the ability to machine understand and process human languages. 
Human languages can be in the form of text or audio format.

# History of NLP

Natural Language Processing started in 1950 When Alan Mathison Turing published an article in the name Computing Machinery and Intelligence. 
It is based on Artificial intelligence. It talks about automatic interpretation and generation of natural language. 
As the technology evolved, different approaches have come to deal with NLP tasks.

1. Heuristics-Based NLP:  This is the initial approach of NLP. It is based on defined rules. Which comes from domain knowledge and expertise. Example: regex
   
2. Statistical Machine learning-based NLP: It is based on statistical rules and machine learning algorithms.
   In this approach, algorithms are applied to the data and learned from the data, and applied to various tasks.
   Examples: Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM), etc.
   
3. Neural Network-based NLP: This is the latest approach that comes with the evaluation of neural network-based learning, known as Deep learning.
   It provides good accuracy, but it is a very data-hungry and time-consuming approach. It requires high computational power to train the model.
   Furthermore, it is based on neural network architecture. Examples: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Transformers, etc.


# Components of NLP

There are two components of Natural Language Processing:

1. Natural Language Understanding
2. Natural Language Generation


# Applications of NLP

The applications of Natural Language Processing are as follows:

1. Text and speech processing like-Voice assistants – Alexa, Siri, etc.
2. Text classification like Grammarly, Microsoft Word, and Google Docs
3. Information extraction like-Search engines like DuckDuckGo, Google
4. Chatbot and Question Answering like:- website bots
5. Language Translation like:- Google Translate
6. Text summarization
